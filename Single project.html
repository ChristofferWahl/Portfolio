            <p>Superconvex Battery is a <b>climate smart</b> type of battery that charges itself.<br>The aim was to create a battery that could
            be used in any location or climate without the need for an external power source. To do this, we developed a unique
            <b>self-charging technology</b> that could harness energy from the environment and convert it into electrical energy to charge
            the battery.</p></div>

            <div class="projecttxt">
            <p>After successfully developing and testing the technology, the we install the prototype battery in a remote location in
            order to further test its capabilities. However, soon after we installed the battery, <b>strange things</b> started happening.
            Locals in the area began reporting sightings of unexplained lights and noise coming from the battery's location. Some
            even claimed that they saw ghostly figures near the battery at night. We tried to investigate these claims but were
            unable to find any rational explanation for them.</p>

        <div class="projecttxt1">
            <p>Despite these strange occurrences, the Superconvex Battery continued to <b>function perfectly</b> and continued charging itself
            without any issues. However, as word of these weird sightings spread, more and more people became interested in visiting
            the site where the battery was located. This eventually led to a full-blown outbreak of mass hysteria, with people
            claiming that <b>the battery was evil and possessed by demons</b>.
            We where eventually forced to abandon the project and the Superconvex Battery was never seen or heard from again.</p>
