            <p>The "Defunct Delerium" project is a project that uses absurdism and 
            cosmic horror to make a point about the issues surrounding planned obsolescence. 
            It features a website that simulates the experience of trying to purchase a product
            that has been discontinued.<br><br>
            The website is designed to look like a typical online store, but the products that are available for purchase are all
            discontinued items. The user is able to add these items to their cart, but they are unable to checkout. As the user
            tries to purchase more and more items, the experience becomes increasingly surreal and nightmarish.</p>

            <h4 class="workheader"><b>Future Deconstructed</b></h4>
            <p>When faced with the daunting task of climate change, it can be difficult to know where to start. "Future Deconstructed"
            is a project that deconstructs our current way of life in order to make us aware of the impact our everyday actions have
            on the planet. It is a powerful wake-up call that urges us to reconfigure the core of society and our institutions if we
            want any chance of averting disaster.

                    <p>Superconvex Battery is a climate smart type of battery that charges itself. The aim was to create a battery that could
                    be used in any location or climate without the need for an external power source. To do this, we developed a unique
                    self-charging technology that could harness energy from the environment and convert it into electrical energy to charge
                    the battery.</p>

                    <h4 class="workheader"><b>Turbo Swipe</b></h4>
                    <p>Turbo Swipe is an interaction design project that proposed to bridge 
                    the gap between gestural interfaces on touch
                    screens and the physical world. The project did not go very well for a number of reasons:The core idea of the project was 
                    to create a "swipe" gesture that would allow users to interact with physical objects in
                    the real world. However, we where unable to create a robust enough gesture recognition algorithm that could consistently
                    recognize user input.

                    <p>"Embedded Television" uses embedded and embodied ideals to make a product that affords watching TV in any kind of
                    object. The project was conceived and executed by me and a team of TV experts that I found via Craigslist.
                    The our goal was to create a product that would allow users to watch TV in any kind of object, regardless of its size or
                    shape. This is important so that we would not miss our shows. To do this, we embedded a small TV into a variety of
                    everyday objects, such as a book, a vase, and a lamp.
                        the battery.</p>

                    <p>Ungraphical user extrafaces is an absurdist design project that completely reverses the visual aspects of graphical user
                    interfaces. The project was created in response to the increasing prevalence of graphical user interfaces, which the we
                    felt were becoming too ubiquitous and simplistic.
                    
                    The project sought to create a more complex and confusing interface by removing all visual cues and reversing the basic
                    principles of design. For example, instead of buttons being labelled with words or icons, they were instead labelled
                    with random numbers or symbols.
